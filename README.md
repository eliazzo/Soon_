# Soon_ Take Home Challenge

#### Purpose

This repo was created to showcase the take home challenge assigned by Soon_. Please read below for justifications for my workflow and choices.

#### User Stories

As a user, I want to:
- Add items to my basket
- Remove items from my basket
- View my basket
- View the total number of items in my basket
- View the total price in my basket


#### Instructions

Clone the repo using the following terminal command: 
``git clone https://github.com/eliazzo/Soon_ main``

### Workflow

#### Alert notice

The Alert functions are designed to guide the user through the page. For example, when you have opted to add the maximum number of items to the bag, it will guide you towards the 'Add to basket' button.

**This is not a feature I would include in a 'real-life' situation but clarifies my intended user flow.**

#### Basket curtain

- Click the basket icon to open the 'curtain' and view the basket
- The basket shows information about the item added to the bag
- The basket shows the number of items added to the bag
- The basket shows the total cost of items in the bag


### Testing

A testing library was developed to test that each user story is met. Test results are shown in the console.

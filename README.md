# Soon_ Take Home Challenge

#### Purpose

This repo was created to showcase the take home challenge assigned by Soon_. Please read below for features and justifications for my workflow and choices.

Enjoy!

#### Instructions

``git clone https://github.com/eliazzo/Soon_ main``

### Workflow

#### Alert notice

- Alert() is designed to guide you through the page. E.g. when you have opted to add 3 items to the bag, it will guide you towards the 'Add to basket' button

#### Basket curtain

- I wanted to add a feature that will (hopefully) differentiate my project in some way from the rest of the cohorts 
- Click the basket icon to open the curtain
- The basket curtain responds to the number of items added to the bag
